          A final-year student pursuing Computer Science & Engineering at Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, 
          Chennai. Mainly interested in Machine Learning & Full Stack Web Development. Since beginning my journey as a

          As the vice president of Sri Chaitanya Techno School, I have organized several workshops, 
          events, and debates. I believe that with patience and balance, we can achieve anything in life.
